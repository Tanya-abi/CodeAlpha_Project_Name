# Age Calculator with Fun Facts

This project is an interactive web application that allows users to input their birthdate, calculate their age, and receive a fun fact based on their age group. The app validates the entered birthdate and ensures that it is not in the future or empty. Once the birthdate is validated, the user is presented with a fun fact related to age and a personalized message reflecting their age group.

## Features

- Date of Birth Input: Users can enter their birthdate using a date picker.
- Age Calculation: Calculates the user's age based on the entered birthdate.
- Age Group Message: Displays a fun message based on the user's calculated age (e.g., childhood, teenage years, twenties, etc.).
- Fun Fact: Random fun facts about age, such as how many times your heart beats by the time you're 30 or how old you are on other planets.
- Validation: Ensures the input is not empty and the birthdate is not in the future.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs their birthdate using the provided form.
2. The app validates the birthdate to ensure it’s not empty or in the future.
3. If the birthdate is valid, the app calculates the user’s age and displays a message based on their age group.
4. The app also displays a random fun fact related to aging or birthdates.
5. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks required).

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd age-calculator
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the app in action.

## Usage

- Enter Birthdate: Use the input field to select a date.
- Submit Form: After selecting your birthdate, click the "Submit" button.
- View Results: The app will display your calculated age and a fun fact based on your age.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure of the form and age display area.
- `styles.css`: Provides the styling for the form and age output display.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling form validation, age calculation, and displaying fun facts.

## Example

1. User selects a birthdate (e.g., `1995-03-25`).
2. The app calculates the age and displays:
   - "You're 29 years old."
   - A fun fact like "By the time you’re 60, you will have spent about 20 years of your life sleeping."
